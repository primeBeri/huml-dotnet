## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Report vulnerabilities privately via
[GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/primeBeri/huml-dotnet/security/advisories/new).

## Scope

Huml.Net is a parsing and serialisation library with zero external runtime dependencies.
The primary concerns are:

- **Denial of service** via deeply nested or pathological HUML inputs (controlled by
  `HumlOptions.MaxRecursionDepth`).
- **Unsafe deserialisation** of attacker-controlled HUML into .NET types.

Out of scope: vulnerabilities in the build toolchain, test fixtures, or documentation.
